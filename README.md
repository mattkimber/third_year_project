# Vehicle and Trailer Simulation
## (Final Year University Project)

Presented for historical interest. This is my final year project from university, a vehicle
and trailer simulation game.

Contains huge numbers of anti-patterns, including things we knew better about even back
in 2003. Not least that I probably should have switched to C++ once I realised I was
inventing my own OO layer in vanilla C.

Uses the following libraries:

* SDL
* ODE (physics library)
* OpenGL
* GLU

Due to the age of the code you may well encounter compatibility issues with more recent
versions of these libraries. Sadly one of the many anti-patterns from 15 years ago is
I don't have a listing of the necessary versions.
